## Notes

- This report records a **compliance check against the reviewed WPF standard**, not an original generation trace — the skill predates this audit.
- Normalization applied during the audit: description trimmed 2826 → 929 chars; corrupted em-dash (`â€"`) in `compatibility` repaired; `source-commit` corrected from the WPF docs commit (`b16066c6`) to the WinForms docs HEAD; the skill moved into `skills/`; an `examples/quickstart.cs` added.
- Coverage spans `GridControl` views (GridView, BandedGridView, AdvBandedGridView, CardView, LayoutView, TileView, WinExplorerView) plus the `TreeList` (see also the dedicated `devexpress-winforms-tree-list` skill).

## Placeholders Requiring Verification

None found (0 `// TODO: Verify API` markers across SKILL.md, references, and examples).
